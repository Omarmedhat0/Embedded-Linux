# The usage of /dev/loop

The `/dev/loop` interface in Linux is associated with loop devices, which are virtual block devices that allow a file to be mounted as if it were a physical block device. This can be useful for various purposes, such as creating disk images, mounting ISO files, or working with encrypted filesystems. The loop device provides a way to access the contents of a file as if it were a block device.
